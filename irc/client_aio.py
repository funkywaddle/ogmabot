"""
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) asyncio-based protocol client library.

This an extension of the IRC client framework in irc.client that replaces
original select-based event loop with one that uses Python 3's native
asyncio event loop.

This implementation shares many of the features of its select-based
cousin, including:

  * Abstraction of the IRC protocol.
  * Handles multiple simultaneous IRC server connections.
  * Handles server PONGing transparently.
  * Messages to the IRC server are done by calling methods on an IRC
    connection object.
  * Messages from an IRC server triggers events, which can be caught
    by event handlers.
  * Reading from and writing to IRC server sockets are normally done
    by an internal select() loop, but the select()ing may be done by
    an external main loop.
  * Functions can be registered to execute at specified times by the
    event-loop.
  * Decodes CTCP tagging correctly (hopefully); I haven't seen any
    other IRC client implementation that handles the CTCP
    specification subtleties.
  * A kind of simple, single-server, object-oriented IRC client class
    that dispatches events to instance methods is included.

Current limitations:
  * DCC chat has not yet been implemented
  * DCC file transfers are not suppored
  * RFCs 2810, 2811, 2812, and 2813 have not been considered.

Notes:
  * connection.quit() only sends QUIT to the server.
  * ERROR from the server triggers the error event and the disconnect event.
  * dropping of the connection triggers the disconnect event.
